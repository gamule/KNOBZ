todo:

-improve EEPROM initializing routine if its the first time - not enough memory untill now.
-add settings.midiChannel (for note - buttons) menu entry or way to set
-optimize draw in menu. just redraw parts of screen in some cases
    -stop flickering in main screen if moving two knobs at the same time: at some timer to limit the changing of current knob. disturbs midi forwarding sometimes.
    -stop flickering in menu. incorporate oled writing stuff in menu loop directly to only rewrite the current changing number.
-cycle led colour from millis()

code optimization:
-button.h - maybe not all vars are used. omit unused functionality

done:
-check automatic loading of recent slot at setup()
-midi channel is displayed incorrectly. shown channel + 1 is actual channel. shown channel 16 is actually channel 0. Fix this behaviour.
-change note button behaviour: note on on press, note off on release
-tick indicator leds upon note button press
-add / test lidar sensor.
-load settings.midiChannel (for note - buttons) from eeprom
-fix oled text positions
-overshoot knobs range a bit, so knobs will reach extremes garanteed
-fix display timeout
-remove bug in saving/loading
-track / fix midichannels. 0 blocks midi transmission on Serial1. use 1-16 for uartmidi and also for menu
-fix value when setting min / max - should send absolute value. 
-add set channels and ccs to default at first startup
-add repeat on change menu item
-removed all delay(), converted code to be non-blocking, thus all midi data should be forwarded
-forward dinmidi to usbmidi
-add hardware midiout jack presence pin to control out-led
-add hardware miditru
-disable output scaling on min and max editing mode
-move global settings to save slots
-forward usb midi to dinmidi
-forward dinmidi to usbmidi
-min should only go to 127-margin, max only to margin
-cleanup / reorder menu items to separate knob-specifics from globals 
-reset all min / max routine
-add set all channel routine
-add clear all routine
-load config at startup and indicate on oled on startup, track last loaded config globally and reload that on startup
-save config of all knobs
-add save anim
-show knob index on min and max homestates
-cc conflict warning
-midi activity led to non blocking
-led startup anim
-fix neopixel anims
-menu
-cc/channel editor
-buttons
-midi activity led
-usb midi
-add smoothing option (maybe hardcode to knobs only)
-improve knob filtering: average to full 10 bits, then if(difference is high enough) update value.

dream features:
-name presets / show preset name on startup
